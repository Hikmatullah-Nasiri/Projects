    <h3>Plows</h3>
    <p>                                      
There are more types of plows than you anyone cares to name. Select the right combination of plows 
 for your farm based on your soil type, your type of crop production and 
the condition of the land.

Moldboard plows: These are most often used on land that has not been in crop production before or has been fallow for a long time. 
The large wings of the plow are designed to cut into and turn over all of the soil in an area.
Chisel Plow: This has long shanks that turn over the soil to a depth of 12 inches. Chisel plowing after applying a soil amendment can
 incorporate the amendment to 3 to 4 inches, and crop residues that are turned over during the plowing are concentrated in that soil depth,
as well, according to Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service. Chisel plowing still leaves some crop residue on the soil surface and
 usually doesn’t create a seedbed that’s smooth enough to plant into—you need further soil prep for that.
Disk Plow: This cuts into the soil but doesn’t turn it over completely the way a moldboard plow would.
Expected Price: Plows generally cost a couple of hundred dollars and are easy to find used or new.
