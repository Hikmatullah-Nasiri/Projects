  <h3>Tractor</h3>
    <p>
There never was a more broad category of farm equipment than this one. If only choosing a tractor were as simple as 
choosing a color—though many farmers with brand allegiance will tell you it is.

Tractors (one of which is pictured above) are available in sizes appropriate for farmers with 1 acre all the way up to 
those working 1,000 acres or more. As versatile as these pieces of farm equipment are, a tractor is a pretty common-sense
rent for small-scale farmers. You want one that has the right amount of horsepower and the right hitch rating for the
work you plan to do with it. Hobby Farms has guides including 8 Things to Consider When Buying a Tractor and 4 Tractor
                                             Types to 
Consider for Your Farm.

Expected Price: Expect to spend a few thousand to ten lacks of rupees on a tractor, depending on whether you rent
   as what features and accessories you choose. (Here’s a start to finding out about those: 13
Tractor Terms Every Hobby Farmer Should Know)

 <h3>Two-Wheeled Tractor</h3>
           <p>
Also known as a walk-behind tractor, this piece of equipment is worth consideration for the smallest-scale farm. 
 You truly do walk behind it, as the name implies, and you can use a range of attachments: hay baler, rototiller,
                   snow blower, bed shaper, seeder, wagon and so on.
