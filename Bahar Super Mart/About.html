<td class="content_text">
<p>After 2002, the charismatic Chairman and CEO of SMN Investment 
Limited, Hikmatullah Nasiri returned home to support private sector 
development in Afghanistan. His aim was to increase&nbsp; the employment
 ratio, promote skill development programs and, introduce world class 
quality of products and services and the latest technology in 
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The concept of formation of Bahar as a Superstore in which every 
type of local and international products to be introduced became a 
reality under the supervision of Engineer Atiqullah Sarwari. He is a 
well respected Afghan businessman, who ran his own chain of superstores 
in Canada. Engineer Atiqullah Sarwari gave shape and structure to the ambition
 of Mr. Nasiri&nbsp; until we created the brand&nbsp;"Bahar".</p>

<p>Bahar Superstores is the retail division of the SMN Investment 
Group. It is the first chain of retail superstores in Afghanistan and 
plans to grow throughout the country. The first Bahar store opened its 
doors in 2006 and now the Bahar group boasts 6 superstores in Kabul, 
employing over 400 people. The retail group has a market capitalization 
of US$1.5 million, monthly. Such success would not be possible without 
our highly capable core team at the helm.</p>
